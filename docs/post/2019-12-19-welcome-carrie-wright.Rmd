In September 2019, we welcomed [Carrie Wright](https://opencasestudies.github.io/authors/cwright/) to the OCS Team as a Research Associate faculty in the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab](https://jhudatascience.org) working on building Open Case Studies. 
She completed her postdoctoral fellowship at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development where she was a co-founder of the [LIBD rstats club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/). 
We are all very excited to have her join the team and leverage her expertise in data analysis to building open case studies. 

In just the last few months, she has revamped the website and is taking the lead on building 10 case studies focused on public health challenges funded by [Bloomberg Philanthropies](https://www.bloomberg.org). 

Stay tuned over the next few months as we add new case studies!
